Udacity Classic Arcade Game Clone

In this game you have a Rocket-Ship and multiple Planes. The goal of the Rocket-Ship is to reach the Stratosphere without colliding into any one of the Planes. The Rocket-Ship can move left, right, up and down. The Planes move in varying speeds on the Blue-Sky portion of the screen. Once a the Rocket-Ship collides with a Plane, there is an explosion, the game is reset, and the Rocket-Ship moves back to the start square. Once the Rocket-Ship reaches the Stratosphere the game is won and victory alert is generated.
